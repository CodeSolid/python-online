# Juptyer Online at CodeSolid


This is a JupyterLite project allowing you to run Python and Jupyter in the browser Codesolid at [jupyter.codesolid.com](https://jupyter.codesolid.com/lab/index.html?path=index.ipynb)

[![lite-badge](https://jupyterlite.rtfd.io/en/latest/_static/badge.svg)](https://jupyter.codesolid.com/lab/index.html?path=index.ipynb)

This project is based on the awesome [JupyterLite](https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite) project, which uses WebAssembly and Pyodide to allow running a fast JupyterLab environment in the browser.

For a tutorial showing how I added this site to CodeSolid, check out [Jupyter Lite: Python in the Browser with Serverless Jupyter](https://codesolid.com/jupyter-lite-python-in-the-browser-with-serverless-jupyter/).
